{"url": "https://www.tcetmumbai.in/aboutexamsection.html", "content": "Thakur College of Engineering and Technology (TCET) received the Autonomous status from Academic year\n              2019-2020 with six branches of engineering (E&TC, COMP, IT, ELEX, MECH, CIVIL). Since then, TCET has\n              evolved into many changes to ensure the quality of education imparted and in the student’s progression.\n              The holistic approach towards the overall development of the student is adapted and the new scheme CBCGS-H\n              2019 with 25-75 pattern (Internal Assessment of 25 marks and End Semester Examination of 75 marks). Also\n              introduced the Major/Minor specialization degree in emerging areas in each branch with an additional\n              credits of 18 to 20 to be earned through MOOCS or SWAYAM platform. The question paper setting for all examinations was done at institute level and blind selection of a\n              question paper out of the set of 3 papers was introduced from December 2019 exam. All the results were\n              prepared by the Institute and declared after moderation by the Board of Examinations. The results were\n              uploaded on the Institute website.\n              The open House facility was introduced for transparency, where students saw their answer books and raised\n              their grievance, if any, which were resolved, and they were advised to apply for revaluation if they are\n              not satisfied with the assessment in any of the subjects.\n              The unsuccessful students were facilitated by introducing a supplementary examination for theory,\n              conducted within a month from the declaration of the result, with the same procedure of the ESE. As the pandemic erupted the facilities for conducting classes and examinations were created immediately by\n              the institute as per the guidelines from the government time to time, so that no academic loss to the\n              students happened. All the Examinations and Assessments were conducted in online mode.\n              The grade cards were prepared by the Institute with features like Barcode, Hologram etc. for restricting\n              duplicity or any malpractice. The course completion certificates with the information such as medium of\n              instruction of the course and the CGPI obtained by the student, instead of provisional degree certificate\n              which were provided by the University, were introduced, and distributed along the grade cards. The\n              transcripts were prepared and provided as per the requirements of the students. In A.Y. 2020-2021 continued with a same scheme CBCGS-H 2019 and introduced three new branches of Bachelor\n              of Technology (B.Tech.) in Artificial Intelligence & Data Structure (AI&DS), Artificial Intelligence &\n              Machine Learning (AI&ML), and Internet of Things (IOT). After the pandemic, as per the guidelines, all the\n              examinations were conducted offline.\n              From the A.Y. 2021-2022, the scheme was revised to CBCGS-HME 2020 with Holistic and Multidisciplinary\n              Education approach, with a 40:60 pattern. Internal Assessment of 40 marks consisting of three In-Semester\n              Examination of 20 marks each considering average of best two out of three, and Innovative Examination of\n              20 Marks and End Semester Examination of 60 marks. The Innovative examination was introduced to inculcate\n              the research aptitude in the students. As per “AICTE INTERNSHIP POLICY: GUIDELINES & PROCEDURES” the 100\n              activity points were introduced and the certificate for the completion of the 100 activity points was\n              issued along with the Semester VIII grade card. Also, there was an increase in intake with additional\n              branches of BE (CS&E, MME, E&CS) and B.VOC (AI&DS). All the examinations were conducted as regular\n              practice. In A.Y. 2022-23 a new branch of B.Voc. (Software Development) was started. All the examinations were\n              conducted as regular practice. The open House and revaluation facility was extended to the repeater\n              students from this academic year.\n              In A.Y. 2022-23, revision of the scheme is done by inclusion of Universal Human Value -II as suggested by\n              AICTE. The evaluation scheme and process were unchanged. The Placement Linked Internship program for Final\n              year BE and B.Tech. was introduced with the online assessment of all internal assessment facility for\n              those who have opted for PLI. Further, for the Specialization (Honours/Minor) Degree, courses offered will\n              be conducted at Institute level in face-to-face mode and evaluated. However, the option for MOOCS and\n              SWAYAM platform will also be open for interested candidates. This will be applicable from semester IV of\n              ongoing batch with 4 courses with total of 18 credits. New branches of B.Voc. Animation & Graphics Design\n              (AGD) and Data Analytics (DA) were introduced. About Examination Cell Evaluation and Assessment Under Autonomous Quick Links"}

The\r\n                  knowledge, skills and competency of engineers required by industry for enhancing their competitiveness\r\n                  in the market need to be developed from post graduate education and research in engineering and\r\n                  technology. The Post Graduate Research in specialized subject have enhanced academic out comes. The\r\n                  teaching and research facilities created for conducting PG projects have connected institutes with\r\n                  industry for consultancy and research. The students with advance knowledge and special skills would be\r\n                  able to offer innovative ideas, technology, product and process in national development process and\r\n                  fulfill their career goals. Over the past few years students are actively involved in research in\r\n                  majorly three domains: Data Science, Soft Computing and Networking & Information Security. Data science as a concept emerges from the applications of existing studies of measurement,\r\n                    representation, interpretation, and management to problems in commerce, health, environment,\r\n                    government, and other domains. Almost every interaction with technology includes data—Amazon\r\n                    purchases, Facebook feed, Netflix recommendations, and even the facial recognition required to sign\r\n                    in to your phone. Ultimately, data science matters because people are able to make better decisions\r\n                    about the world and domain-specific research is being done in the field of healthcare, business,\r\n                    Agriculture, Retail, Finance etc. Soft computing is an emerging approach to computing which parallels the remarkable ability of the\r\n                    human mind to reason and learn in an environment of uncertainty and imprecision. It is the main\r\n                    motivation behind the idea of conceptual intelligence in machines in different applications areas as\r\n                    Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, Evolutionary Computation and Genetic algorithms. Now, soft computing\r\n                    is the only solution when we don’t have any mathematical modeling for problem solving, we need a\r\n                    solution to a complex problem in real time which is easy to adapt to changed scenario and can be\r\n                    implemented with parallel computing. It has enormous applications in medical diagnosis, computer\r\n                    vision, hand written character recognition, pattern recognition, machine intelligence, weather\r\n                    forecasting, network optimization, VLSI design, etc. The techniques of soft computing are nowadays\r\n                    being used successfully in many domestic, commercial, and industrial applications. We are in a time where businesses are more digitally advanced than ever, and as technology improves,\r\n                    organizations’ security postures must be enhanced as well. Failure to do so could result in a costly\r\n                    data breach, as we’ve seen happen with many businesses. The cybercrime landscape has evolved, and\r\n                    threat actors are going after any type of organization, so in order to protect your business’s data,\r\n                    money and reputation, it is critical that you invest in an advanced security system. But before you\r\n                    can start developing a security program for your organization, it’s critical that you understand the\r\n                    different types of security and how they all work together. Information security (also known as\r\n                    InfoSec) ensures that both physical and digital data is protected from unauthorized access, use,\r\n                    disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction. Information security\r\n                    differs from cyber security in that InfoSec aims to keep data in any form secure, whereas cyber\r\n                    security protects only digital data. If your business is starting to develop a security program,\r\n                    information security is where you should first begin, as it is the foundation for data security.

{"url": "https://ncc.tcetmumbai.in/", "content": "Adoption of the motto of NCC The motto of NCC is 'Unity & Discipline' which was adopted on 23 Dec 1957. In living up to its motto, the NCC strives to be and is one of the greatest cohesive forces of the nation, bringing together the youth hailing from different parts of the country and moulding them into united, secular and disciplined citizens of the nation. The National Cadet Corps is the Indian military cadet corps with its headquarters at New Delhi. It is \n              open to school and college students on a voluntary basis. National Cadet Corps in India is a voluntary \n              organization which recruits cadets from schools, colleges, professional colleges and universities all \n              over India. Cadets are given basic military training in small arms, physical fitness and outdoor parade \n              training. In addition to military training, cadets are given training on personality development, \n              building and social upbringing. Cadets can also join active military service if found eligible & suitable \n              after completion of the ‘C’ certificate course of NCC. They are given preference over other candidates \n              in the Indian Armed Forces. TCET-NCC Unit was established in the month of October 2021 under the approval of the NCC \n              directorate, Group 'A' Mumbai with a sanctioned strength of 104 cadets. Regular indoor/outdoor \n              training and activities are being conducted under the guidance of mentor & Officer In-charge Cdr. \n              Vijay Pratap Singh and Lt.(Dr.) Nivant Kamble. The NCC aims at developing character, comradeship, discipline, a secular outlook, the spirit of adventure and ideals of selfless service amongst young citizens. This discipline translates into other aspects of life and contributes to building self-confidence and resilience. Sports teach discipline, self-control, and the importance of following rules. Through regular practice and training, athletes learn to set goals, work hard, and persevere. Increasing awareness regarding Defence forces and how to join them. Social Activities such as Puneet Sagar Abhiyan, Blood Donation, Tree Plantation, Prayaas, etc. An utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward. Vol.1 Vol.2 Vol.3 Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results. \n            Have a look at our team of cadets! \"A thoughtful mind when it sees the national flag, sees not the flag, but the nation itself.\" - Henry Ward Beecher\n\n                  The trademark of NCC TCET is giving the rarest opportunities to its cadets. NCC bestows the providential opportunity of saluting the flag twice a year, on Independence Day and Republic Day. The cadets also get a chance to give the coveted Guard of Honour to the higher rank officers of defense forces. When cadets pass by the flag, with uniform and ceremonials put on, the heartbeats synchronize with the beats of the march past, the salute becoming a reflex and eyes of the audience on them, there is no better feeling than that! Physical fitness, sense of discipline and untiy along with that exemption in couple of exam. Qualify the physical test and fill the required form . No, it's absolutely free to join but there will be nominal fees for joining which will be furbished later on completely. On different occasions there will be an  event/Fallin and there will be  few other activities i.e.- beach cleaning, donation drive  and few other social works A-Block, Thakur Educational Campus, Shyamnarayan Thakur Marg, Thakur Village, Kandivali East, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400101 tcetncc@gmail.com © Copyright .

{"url": "https://ncc.tcetmumbai.in/index.html", "content": "Adoption of the motto of NCC The motto of NCC is 'Unity & Discipline' which was adopted on 23 Dec 1957. In living up to its motto, the NCC strives to be and is one of the greatest cohesive forces of the nation, bringing together the youth hailing from different parts of the country and moulding them into united, secular and disciplined citizens of the nation. The National Cadet Corps is the Indian military cadet corps with its headquarters at New Delhi. It is \n              open to school and college students on a voluntary basis. National Cadet Corps in India is a voluntary \n              organization which recruits cadets from schools, colleges, professional colleges and universities all \n              over India. Cadets are given basic military training in small arms, physical fitness and outdoor parade \n              training. In addition to military training, cadets are given training on personality development, \n              building and social upbringing. Cadets can also join active military service if found eligible & suitable \n              after completion of the ‘C’ certificate course of NCC. They are given preference over other candidates \n              in the Indian Armed Forces. TCET-NCC Unit was established in the month of October 2021 under the approval of the NCC \n              directorate, Group 'A' Mumbai with a sanctioned strength of 104 cadets. Regular indoor/outdoor \n              training and activities are being conducted under the guidance of mentor & Officer In-charge Cdr. \n              Vijay Pratap Singh and Lt.(Dr.) Nivant Kamble. The NCC aims at developing character, comradeship, discipline, a secular outlook, the spirit of adventure and ideals of selfless service amongst young citizens. This discipline translates into other aspects of life and contributes to building self-confidence and resilience. Sports teach discipline, self-control, and the importance of following rules. Through regular practice and training, athletes learn to set goals, work hard, and persevere. Increasing awareness regarding Defence forces and how to join them. Social Activities such as Puneet Sagar Abhiyan, Blood Donation, Tree Plantation, Prayaas, etc. An utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward. Vol.1 Vol.2 Vol.3 Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results. \n            Have a look at our team of cadets! \"A thoughtful mind when it sees the national flag, sees not the flag, but the nation itself.\" - Henry Ward Beecher\n\n                  The trademark of NCC TCET is giving the rarest opportunities to its cadets. NCC bestows the providential opportunity of saluting the flag twice a year, on Independence Day and Republic Day. The cadets also get a chance to give the coveted Guard of Honour to the higher rank officers of defense forces. When cadets pass by the flag, with uniform and ceremonials put on, the heartbeats synchronize with the beats of the march past, the salute becoming a reflex and eyes of the audience on them, there is no better feeling than that! Physical fitness, sense of discipline and untiy along with that exemption in couple of exam. Qualify the physical test and fill the required form . No, it's absolutely free to join but there will be nominal fees for joining which will be furbished later on completely. On different occasions there will be an  event/Fallin and there will be  few other activities i.e.- beach cleaning, donation drive  and few other social works A-Block, Thakur Educational Campus, Shyamnarayan Thakur Marg, Thakur Village, Kandivali East, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400101 tcetncc@gmail.com © Copyright .

The development of people is the ultimate goal of Extension education and Field Outreach activities.\n                Providing research-based information, teaching people new knowledge and skills, helping them to improve\n                production or increase income. The methods of Extension education and Field Outreach activities arise from proven principles, and the\n                most effective Extension Educators and Field Outreach activists know and use a variety of teaching\n                methods. Extension work is most successful as it involves learners in its programs so thoroughly that they set\n                their own goals, apply new ideas and receive feedback from others about their progress. Extension does\n                not dictate how people will solve problems or make decisions for them. Rather, it fosters the democratic\n                ideal of self-governance by encouraging each person or group to choose the best among a variety of\n                options.

Student exchange program gives an opportunity for students  to broaden their knowledge on their study of choice from a different institute.  This gives them a chance to develop their work experience by seeing how the  course/research domain they are studying is being practiced in another  institute. It  helps them to understand the working philosophy of the other institute and also  enhances their ability to work in collaboration for project development and  paper writing with students of other institute. The purpose is to learn the  culture, living styles, social customs, food habits and such other aspects of  the social and cultural affairs of each other’s institute along with learning  technical skills regarding a latest technology. Time to time, there are notifications from various government bodies for  Government Initiatives and National Recognitions/Awards for students/Faculty  like EBSB Initiatives, MyGov activities, Vishwakarma awards. Students/Faculty  from TCET can participate to get national recognition for individual and  institute. This will also help for nation building.

The spokes of the wheel point the way to further and continuing development. These would include\r\ncourses & opportunities for building soft skills, vocational skills, skills that lead to expression of creativity,\r\nskills that lead to livelihoods, empowerment and dignity. The wheel will also include paths for higher\r\neducation, vocational education, lifelong learning, which includes training and re-training. Points on the rim represent the potential that an\r\nindividual can realise on the basis of the core at the\r\ncentre and the pathway/spoke that the learner has\r\ntravelled down. The multiple spokes of creativity will add\r\nto the strength and structure of the\r\nwheel, thereby rendering it more stable. Technology will be the lubricant for the\r\nwheel, enabling the structure to be\r\nsmoothly mobile."}

National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and Technology Vision (TV) 2035 are  some of the major current initiatives, which can transform the education system and envision futuristic technology to make India developed and self-sustained.\r\n\r\nAs India moves towards becoming a knowledge economy and society, more and more young Indians are likely to aspire for higher education. NEP 2020 focuses on education system of India which significantly contributes towards sustainable livelihoods and economic development of the nation. The vision of the Policy is to develop knowledge, skills, values, and dispositions that support responsible commitment to human rights, sustainable development and living, and global well-being, thereby reflecting a truly global citizen. This also aims at universalization of education with increased Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) and a goal of making India a global study destination by 2030. The policy envisages broad-based, multi-disciplinary,  holistic  education  with  flexible  curricula,  creative  combinations  of subjects, integration of vocational education and multiple entry and exit points with appropriate certification. The policy also ensures to keep India’s talent to stay and contribute towards India’s growth and development.\r\n\r\nTechnology Vision 2035 is another perspective plan which would enable a more calibrated approach  to  technological  progression.  The  TV  2035  roots  itself  into  the  collective aspirations, ambitions, and expectations of Indians to get themselves experience the evolution of technology vision for the country. Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC), an autonomous organization under the Department of Science & Technology  has  been  constantly  working  on  achieving  these  technological  horizons  by plotting  the technology trajectories. It is imperative that technology is the key driver for empowering individuals, societies and countries. It facilitates development in all its dimensions to enhance human capabilities. It has been a game changer in the growth of world economy, entrepreneurship, and employability. Therefore, it is essential to embark upon an exercise to explore technological possibilities to attain the development goals. Looking into new opportunities in the emerging knowledge economy era, it is our responsibility as a stakeholder to ensure the accessibility of quality engineering  education to aspiring  potential  students  with  a  rewarding  career  to  create  sustainable  society. With an effective implementation of both NEP 2020 and  TV 2035 once again likely to increase the demand of E&T education  in the country. Integration of these documents in the curriculum will bring the learning diversity  and inclusiveness. Integration will not only enhance the content, pedagogy and technology in education but will also embed the career vision with multiple career options with global opportunities. The new curriculum  is  expected  to  promote  holistic  and  multidisciplinary  to    improvement  and enhance the employability skills. It will also ensure to provide access to all stakeholders to contribute towards the development of a knowledge society, which will help in technological progress,   globalization   of   the   world   economy,   increased   importance   of   specialized knowledge,  increased awareness of the importance of knowledge for country´s economic development and creation of new jobs. This will transform India to become an equitable and vibrant knowledge society, by providing high-quality education, by enhancing employability and employment, and thereby making India a global knowledge superpower.\r\n\r\nThakur College of Engineering and Technology has always been in the forefront to initiate and support such government ingenuities by providing the platform for all stakeholders from industry and academia. One Day National Symposium on “Implementation of NEP 2020: A perspective  to  enhance  Employability  and  Employments  of  Engineering  Graduates”  is a platform to engage the huge pool of human resources to see the realization of vision of India as a developed technological nation where every engineering graduate desirous of job should be industry ready for global career and get the job as per the potential and talent.

The spokes of the wheel point the way to further and continuing development. These would include\r\ncourses & opportunities for building soft skills, vocational skills, skills that lead to expression of creativity,\r\nskills that lead to livelihoods, empowerment and dignity. The wheel will also include paths for higher\r\neducation, vocational education, lifelong learning, which includes training and re-training. Points on the rim represent the potential that an\r\nindividual can realise on the basis of the core at the\r\ncentre and the pathway/spoke that the learner has\r\ntravelled down. The multiple spokes of creativity will add\r\nto the strength and structure of the\r\nwheel, thereby rendering it more stable. Technology will be the lubricant for the\r\nwheel, enabling the structure to be\r\nsmoothly mobile."}

TCET was one among the 16 colleges who were invited for a round table meeting for discussions on framing policies and action plan for conduction of these courses. The Maharashtra Economic Development Council (MEDC) was established in 1957 under the stewardship of (late) Dr. Dhananjayrao Gadgil, eminent Economist and former Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission, Govt. of India.  It was set up by participation of prominent Chambers of Commerce, Business and Industries Associations in Maharashtra, to “facilitate rapid and balanced economic development of Maharashtra”. The Council acts as an Economic Think-Tank for Business & Industry as also for the Government of Maharashtra. The Council has always been fortunate to have eminent personalities and experts from Business & Industry, as Presidents, who have actively supported and guided the affairs of the Council. This has made MEDC a unique Research & Development Organisation not only in Maharashtra, but also in India. MEDC is the only organisation focusing exclusive attention on Economic Development of Maharashtra. With its sustained efforts, it has been facilitating rapid and balanced economic and industrial development of the State. As a part of this strategy, MEDC has accorded top priority in its Agenda, to vital issues such as: MEDC is a ‘development catalyst and investment facilitator’ for the State of Maharashtra – a unique, apolitical and autonomous research organisation working proactively with State Government, Business and Industry, Educationists, Professionals, Bankers, Economists and other leading stakeholders on vital issues of economic development. MEDC contributes actively to promote and provoke ‘reasoned thinking’ on matters of socio-economic policy both at the National and State level. MEDC’s mainstay is the Policy-Oriented Research. It brings out research memoranda and informative circulars on various aspects of the Economy in general and trade and industry in particular. It has so far published more than 275 publications which have been well-received. MEDC’s publications are of great value to Governments, Business and Industry, Chambers of Commerce, Universities, Consultants, and Research Scholars and Students.

{"url": "https://www.tcetmumbai.in/TNP%20aboutInternship.html", "content": "Internships are crucial for students, offering real-world work experience\n                that bridges their academic knowledge with practical application. They help in honing leadership skills\n                and provide a competitive edge in the job market. Recognizing this, TCET’s Training and Placement (T&P)\n                Cell has implemented a mandatory internship requirement for its students. Each student must complete a 4\n                to 6-week internship annually, with credits awarded under the Human Skills Development (HSD) category in\n                accordance with AICTE's internship policies. TCET has established a structured internship program that benefits\n                students from their first year. During the first two years, students are required to complete in-house\n                internships, while the latter two years involve external internships facilitated by the T&P Cell. Upon\n                successful completion, students earn between 12 to 15 credits. This initiative has already provided over\n                9,100 students with valuable internship experiences, significantly enhancing their employability and\n                practical skills. By integrating these internships into the curriculum, TCET ensures that its students\n                are well-prepared for the professional world, giving them a substantial advantage as they transition\n                from education to full-time careers.

Engineers are dynamic thinkers who connect science, technology, and\n                society. They\n                contribute to the country's technical and industrial advancements. I am extremely delighted to mention\n                that the\n                distinguished Thakur College of Engineering and Technology (TCET) was founded in 2001-02. Since its\n                inception, it has\n                set the standard for value-based holistic education by concentrating on new technological trends.\n                I am grateful to our Honourable Chairman, Mr. V.K. Singh, whose energetic leadership has been a guiding\n                light over the\n                years. He is a rigid adherent of discipline, devotion, and responsibility. He is the driving force\n                behind all of us, meeting all\n                of our requirements as we work to get the institution to its current state. I proudly welcome all undergraduate and postgraduate students to Thakur College of Engineering and\n                Technology\n                (TCET). TCET offers well-qualified, experienced, passionate, and highly committed professors who provide\n                personalised attention to each student using innovative, current, and scientific methodologies and\n                advanced\n                technology. Our College's mission is to maintain the highest educational standards and quality while\n                prioritising\n                academic achievement. It was made feasible by sticking to the highest standards of teaching and learning\n                techniques, as\n                well as research. Our quality extends beyond the classroom; we are also quite active in organising\n                conferences,\n                workshops, seminars, speeches, guest lectures, and other extracurricular events. These exercises\n                encourage our\n                students to think beyond the box, which adds significant value to their professional performance. According to recent observations and surveys, the majority of engineering graduates lack the necessary\n                life skills to be\n                employed or establish their own businesses. Various methods of teaching and learning, evaluation and\n                assessment, skill\n                development, and employability of globally practised approaches have been effectively adopted for\n                students' overall\n                growth. To address this gap, we have been changing the curriculum to meet the needs of the sectors while\n                maintaining\n                our autonomy. Students are also encouraged to take online certification courses, which are expected to\n                be integrated as\n                credit in the future. Furthermore, with autonomous status, students can choose extra topics that will\n                contribute towards\n                their extra credits and make them eligible for an honours' degree. “Holistic education,\" which is a strikingly rich fusion of academic, co-curricular, and\n                extracurricular learning and\n                activities, is what TCET practices. As a consequence, the institute was recently granted autonomous\n                status and is\n                currently listed among the top 200 institutes in the nation by national authorities. TCET extends its\n                warm greeting to you\n                once more as you enter in this vibrant and stimulating new field of science and technology. We also wish\n                all prospective\n                students the best possible luck for a fruitful career and a bright future! Principal's Message About TCET"}
