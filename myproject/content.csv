                    that involves students learning and developing skills directly in the workplace. This approach
                    allows new hires or those transitioning to new roles to gain hands-on experience under the guidance
                    of experienced colleagues or supervisors. OJT facilitates immediate application of theoretical
                    knowledge, fosters a deeper understanding of job-specific tasks, and enhances employee engagement by
                    integrating learning with everyday work activities. It also offers the advantage of tailored
                    training that meets the unique needs of both the organization and the individual, promoting a
                    smoother and more effective integration into the company culture and operational processes. In Future at TCET we will be integrating apprenticeship-enabled program
                    of 1 year in the curriculum of B.Voc. An apprenticeship-enabled program provides students with
                    valuable opportunities to gain practical, hands-on experience while still in the educational
                    environment. These programs bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world application by
                    allowing students to work alongside skilled professionals in their chosen field. By offering a
                    direct pathway to employment, apprenticeship programs also help students build professional
                    networks, understand workplace dynamics, and potentially secure permanent positions with their
                    training employers. Internship
