The\r\n                  knowledge, skills and competency of engineers required by industry for enhancing their competitiveness\r\n                  in the market need to be developed from post graduate education and research in engineering and\r\n                  technology. The Post Graduate Research in specialized subject have enhanced academic out comes. The\r\n                  teaching and research facilities created for conducting PG projects have connected institutes with\r\n                  industry for consultancy and research. The students with advance knowledge and special skills would be\r\n                  able to offer innovative ideas, technology, product and process in national development process and\r\n                  fulfill their career goals. Over the past few years students are actively involved in research in\r\n                  majorly three domains: Data Science, Soft Computing and Networking & Information Security. Data science as a concept emerges from the applications of existing studies of measurement,\r\n                    representation, interpretation, and management to problems in commerce, health, environment,\r\n                    government, and other domains. Almost every interaction with technology includes data—Amazon\r\n                    purchases, Facebook feed, Netflix recommendations, and even the facial recognition required to sign\r\n                    in to your phone. Ultimately, data science matters because people are able to make better decisions\r\n                    about the world and domain-specific research is being done in the field of healthcare, business,\r\n                    Agriculture, Retail, Finance etc. Soft computing is an emerging approach to computing which parallels the remarkable ability of the\r\n                    human mind to reason and learn in an environment of uncertainty and imprecision. It is the main\r\n                    motivation behind the idea of conceptual intelligence in machines in different applications areas as\r\n                    Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, Evolutionary Computation and Genetic algorithms. Now, soft computing\r\n                    is the only solution when we don’t have any mathematical modeling for problem solving, we need a\r\n                    solution to a complex problem in real time which is easy to adapt to changed scenario and can be\r\n                    implemented with parallel computing. It has enormous applications in medical diagnosis, computer\r\n                    vision, hand written character recognition, pattern recognition, machine intelligence, weather\r\n                    forecasting, network optimization, VLSI design, etc. The techniques of soft computing are nowadays\r\n                    being used successfully in many domestic, commercial, and industrial applications. We are in a time where businesses are more digitally advanced than ever, and as technology improves,\r\n                    organizations’ security postures must be enhanced as well. Failure to do so could result in a costly\r\n                    data breach, as we’ve seen happen with many businesses. The cybercrime landscape has evolved, and\r\n                    threat actors are going after any type of organization, so in order to protect your business’s data,\r\n                    money and reputation, it is critical that you invest in an advanced security system. But before you\r\n                    can start developing a security program for your organization, it’s critical that you understand the\r\n                    different types of security and how they all work together. Information security (also known as\r\n                    InfoSec) ensures that both physical and digital data is protected from unauthorized access, use,\r\n                    disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction. Information security\r\n                    differs from cyber security in that InfoSec aims to keep data in any form secure, whereas cyber\r\n                    security protects only digital data. If your business is starting to develop a security program,\r\n                    information security is where you should first begin, as it is the foundation for data security.

{"url": "https://ncc.tcetmumbai.in/", "content": "Adoption of the motto of NCC The motto of NCC is 'Unity & Discipline' which was adopted on 23 Dec 1957. In living up to its motto, the NCC strives to be and is one of the greatest cohesive forces of the nation, bringing together the youth hailing from different parts of the country and moulding them into united, secular and disciplined citizens of the nation. The National Cadet Corps is the Indian military cadet corps with its headquarters at New Delhi. It is \n              open to school and college students on a voluntary basis. National Cadet Corps in India is a voluntary \n              organization which recruits cadets from schools, colleges, professional colleges and universities all \n              over India. Cadets are given basic military training in small arms, physical fitness and outdoor parade \n              training. In addition to military training, cadets are given training on personality development, \n              building and social upbringing. Cadets can also join active military service if found eligible & suitable \n              after completion of the ‘C’ certificate course of NCC. They are given preference over other candidates \n              in the Indian Armed Forces. TCET-NCC Unit was established in the month of October 2021 under the approval of the NCC \n              directorate, Group 'A' Mumbai with a sanctioned strength of 104 cadets. Regular indoor/outdoor \n              training and activities are being conducted under the guidance of mentor & Officer In-charge Cdr. \n              Vijay Pratap Singh and Lt.(Dr.) Nivant Kamble. The NCC aims at developing character, comradeship, discipline, a secular outlook, the spirit of adventure and ideals of selfless service amongst young citizens. This discipline translates into other aspects of life and contributes to building self-confidence and resilience. Sports teach discipline, self-control, and the importance of following rules. Through regular practice and training, athletes learn to set goals, work hard, and persevere. Increasing awareness regarding Defence forces and how to join them. Social Activities such as Puneet Sagar Abhiyan, Blood Donation, Tree Plantation, Prayaas, etc. An utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward. Vol.1 Vol.2 Vol.3 Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results. \n            Have a look at our team of cadets! \"A thoughtful mind when it sees the national flag, sees not the flag, but the nation itself.\" - Henry Ward Beecher\n\n                  The trademark of NCC TCET is giving the rarest opportunities to its cadets. NCC bestows the providential opportunity of saluting the flag twice a year, on Independence Day and Republic Day. The cadets also get a chance to give the coveted Guard of Honour to the higher rank officers of defense forces. When cadets pass by the flag, with uniform and ceremonials put on, the heartbeats synchronize with the beats of the march past, the salute becoming a reflex and eyes of the audience on them, there is no better feeling than that! Physical fitness, sense of discipline and untiy along with that exemption in couple of exam. Qualify the physical test and fill the required form . No, it's absolutely free to join but there will be nominal fees for joining which will be furbished later on completely. On different occasions there will be an  event/Fallin and there will be  few other activities i.e.- beach cleaning, donation drive  and few other social works A-Block, Thakur Educational Campus, Shyamnarayan Thakur Marg, Thakur Village, Kandivali East, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400101 tcetncc@gmail.com © Copyright .

In the XI five year plan period (2007-2012), as per\n                the guidelines the existing Departments of all the 80 Universities in India, including eight\n                universities in Maharashtra State is renamed as “Lifelong Learning & Extension”.

The Extension Work Programme with its specific mandate to work for the less privileged sections of the\n                society and our efforts are to extend educational programmes that will enhance and improve the quality\n                of life of such groups in par with today’s socio economic changes taking place with the technology\n                driven knowledge based competitive economy drive. Extension Education and Field Outreach activities\n                always work to encourage people to improve their conditions in all dimensions of their lives. The development of people is the ultimate goal of Extension education and Field Outreach activities.\n                Providing research-based information, teaching people new knowledge and skills, helping them to improve\n                production or increase income. The methods of Extension education and Field Outreach activities arise from proven principles, and the\n                most effective Extension Educators and Field Outreach activists know and use a variety of teaching\n                methods. Extension work is most successful as it involves learners in its programs so thoroughly that they set\n                their own goals, apply new ideas and receive feedback from others about their progress. Extension does\n                not dictate how people will solve problems or make decisions for them. Rather, it fosters the democratic\n                ideal of self-governance by encouraging each person or group to choose the best among a variety of\n                options.

Student exchange program gives an opportunity for students  to broaden their knowledge on their study of choice from a different institute.  This gives them a chance to develop their work experience by seeing how the  course/research domain they are studying is being practiced in another  institute. It  helps them to understand the working philosophy of the other institute and also  enhances their ability to work in collaboration for project development and  paper writing with students of other institute. The purpose is to learn the  culture, living styles, social customs, food habits and such other aspects of  the social and cultural affairs of each other’s institute along with learning  technical skills regarding a latest technology. Time to time, there are notifications from various government bodies for  Government Initiatives and National Recognitions/Awards for students/Faculty  like EBSB Initiatives, MyGov activities, Vishwakarma awards. Students/Faculty  from TCET can participate to get national recognition for individual and  institute. This will also help for nation building.

National Cadet Corps in India is a voluntary \n              organization which recruits cadets from schools, colleges, professional colleges and universities all \n              over India. Cadets are given basic military training in small arms, physical fitness and outdoor parade \n              training. In addition to military training, cadets are given training on personality development, \n              building and social upbringing. Cadets can also join active military service if found eligible & suitable \n              after completion of the ‘C’ certificate course of NCC. They are given preference over other candidates \n              in the Indian Armed Forces. TCET-NCC Unit was established in the month of October 2021 under the approval of the NCC \n              directorate, Group 'A' Mumbai with a sanctioned strength of 104 cadets. Regular indoor/outdoor \n              training and activities are being conducted under the guidance of mentor & Officer In-charge Cdr. \n              Vijay Pratap Singh and Lt.(Dr.) Nivant Kamble. The NCC aims at developing character, comradeship, discipline, a secular outlook, the spirit of adventure and ideals of selfless service amongst young citizens. This discipline translates into other aspects of life and contributes to building self-confidence and resilience. Sports teach discipline, self-control, and the importance of following rules. Through regular practice and training, athletes learn to set goals, work hard, and persevere. Increasing awareness regarding Defence forces and how to join them. Social Activities such as Puneet Sagar Abhiyan, Blood Donation, Tree Plantation, Prayaas, etc. An utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward. Vol.1 Vol.2 Vol.3 Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results. \n            Have a look at our team of cadets! \"A thoughtful mind when it sees the national flag, sees not the flag, but the nation itself.\" - Henry Ward Beecher\n\n                  The trademark of NCC TCET is giving the rarest opportunities to its cadets. NCC bestows the providential opportunity of saluting the flag twice a year, on Independence Day and Republic Day. The cadets also get a chance to give the coveted Guard of Honour to the higher rank officers of defense forces. When cadets pass by the flag, with uniform and ceremonials put on, the heartbeats synchronize with the beats of the march past, the salute becoming a reflex and eyes of the audience on them, there is no better feeling than that! Physical fitness, sense of discipline and untiy along with that exemption in couple of exam. Qualify the physical test and fill the required form . No, it's absolutely free to join but there will be nominal fees for joining which will be furbished later on completely. On different occasions there will be an  event/Fallin and there will be  few other activities i.e.- beach cleaning, donation drive  and few other social works A-Block, Thakur Educational Campus, Shyamnarayan Thakur Marg, Thakur Village, Kandivali East, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400101 tcetncc@gmail.com © Copyright .

National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and Technology Vision (TV) 2035 are  some of the major current initiatives, which can transform the education system and envision futuristic technology to make India developed and self-sustained.\r\n\r\nAs India moves towards becoming a knowledge economy and society, more and more young Indians are likely to aspire for higher education. NEP 2020 focuses on education system of India which significantly contributes towards sustainable livelihoods and economic development of the nation. The vision of the Policy is to develop knowledge, skills, values, and dispositions that support responsible commitment to human rights, sustainable development and living, and global well-being, thereby reflecting a truly global citizen. This also aims at universalization of education with increased Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) and a goal of making India a global study destination by 2030. The policy envisages broad-based, multi-disciplinary,  holistic  education  with  flexible  curricula,  creative  combinations  of subjects, integration of vocational education and multiple entry and exit points with appropriate certification. The policy also ensures to keep India’s talent to stay and contribute towards India’s growth and development.\r\n\r\nTechnology Vision 2035 is another perspective plan which would enable a more calibrated approach  to  technological  progression.  The  TV  2035  roots  itself  into  the  collective aspirations, ambitions, and expectations of Indians to get themselves experience the evolution of technology vision for the country. Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC), an autonomous organization under the Department of Science & Technology  has  been  constantly  working  on  achieving  these  technological  horizons  by plotting  the technology trajectories. It is imperative that technology is the key driver for empowering individuals, societies and countries. It facilitates development in all its dimensions to enhance human capabilities. It has been a game changer in the growth of world economy, entrepreneurship, and employability. Therefore, it is essential to embark upon an exercise to explore technological possibilities to attain the development goals. Looking into new opportunities in the emerging knowledge economy era, it is our responsibility as a stakeholder to ensure the accessibility of quality engineering  education to aspiring  potential  students  with  a  rewarding  career  to  create  sustainable  society.

{"url": "https://www.tcetmumbai.in/iis2021/index.html", "content": "Being one of the nations with youngest population, India is charting out a plan to become the developed nation. National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and Technology Vision (TV) 2035 are  some of the major current initiatives, which can transform the education system and envision futuristic technology to make India developed and self-sustained.\r\n\r\nAs India moves towards becoming a knowledge economy and society, more and more young Indians are likely to aspire for higher education. NEP 2020 focuses on education system of India which significantly contributes towards sustainable livelihoods and economic development of the nation. The vision of the Policy is to develop knowledge, skills, values, and dispositions that support responsible commitment to human rights, sustainable development and living, and global well-being, thereby reflecting a truly global citizen. This also aims at universalization of education with increased Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) and a goal of making India a global study destination by 2030. The policy envisages broad-based, multi-disciplinary,  holistic  education  with  flexible  curricula,  creative  combinations  of subjects, integration of vocational education and multiple entry and exit points with appropriate certification. The policy also ensures to keep India’s talent to stay and contribute towards India’s growth and development.\r\n\r\nTechnology Vision 2035 is another perspective plan which would enable a more calibrated approach  to  technological  progression.  The  TV  2035  roots  itself  into  the  collective aspirations, ambitions, and expectations of Indians to get themselves experience the evolution of technology vision for the country. Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC), an autonomous organization under the Department of Science & Technology  has  been  constantly  working  on  achieving  these  technological  horizons  by plotting  the technology trajectories. It is imperative that technology is the key driver for empowering individuals, societies and countries. It facilitates development in all its dimensions to enhance human capabilities. It has been a game changer in the growth of world economy, entrepreneurship, and employability. Therefore, it is essential to embark upon an exercise to explore technological possibilities to attain the development goals. Looking into new opportunities in the emerging knowledge economy era, it is our responsibility as a stakeholder to ensure the accessibility of quality engineering  education to aspiring  potential  students  with  a  rewarding  career  to  create  sustainable  society. With an effective implementation of both NEP 2020 and  TV 2035 once again likely to increase the demand of E&T education  in the country. Integration of these documents in the curriculum will bring the learning diversity  and inclusiveness. Integration will not only enhance the content, pedagogy and technology in education but will also embed the career vision with multiple career options with global opportunities. The new curriculum  is  expected  to  promote  holistic  and  multidisciplinary  to    improvement  and enhance the employability skills. It will also ensure to provide access to all stakeholders to contribute towards the development of a knowledge society, which will help in technological progress,   globalization   of   the   world   economy,   increased   importance   of   specialized knowledge,  increased awareness of the importance of knowledge for country´s economic development and creation of new jobs. This will transform India to become an equitable and vibrant knowledge society, by providing high-quality education, by enhancing employability and employment, and thereby making India a global knowledge superpower.\r\n\r\nThakur College of Engineering and Technology has always been in the forefront to initiate and support such government ingenuities by providing the platform for all stakeholders from industry and academia. One Day National Symposium on “Implementation of NEP 2020: A perspective  to  enhance  Employability  and  Employments  of  Engineering  Graduates”  is a platform to engage the huge pool of human resources to see the realization of vision of India as a developed technological nation where every engineering graduate desirous of job should be industry ready for global career and get the job as per the potential and talent. Discussions and deliberation in the symposium will help the institutions for the effective implementation of  programme specific  EAE model. - 1.

Since then, TCET has\n              evolved into many changes to ensure the quality of education imparted and in the student’s progression.\n              The holistic approach towards the overall development of the student is adapted and the new scheme CBCGS-H\n              2019 with 25-75 pattern (Internal Assessment of 25 marks and End Semester Examination of 75 marks). Also\n              introduced the Major/Minor specialization degree in emerging areas in each branch with an additional\n              credits of 18 to 20 to be earned through MOOCS or SWAYAM platform. The question paper setting for all examinations was done at institute level and blind selection of a\n              question paper out of the set of 3 papers was introduced from December 2019 exam. All the results were\n              prepared by the Institute and declared after moderation by the Board of Examinations. The results were\n              uploaded on the Institute website.\n              The open House facility was introduced for transparency, where students saw their answer books and raised\n              their grievance, if any, which were resolved, and they were advised to apply for revaluation if they are\n              not satisfied with the assessment in any of the subjects.\n              The unsuccessful students were facilitated by introducing a supplementary examination for theory,\n              conducted within a month from the declaration of the result, with the same procedure of the ESE. As the pandemic erupted the facilities for conducting classes and examinations were created immediately by\n              the institute as per the guidelines from the government time to time, so that no academic loss to the\n              students happened. All the Examinations and Assessments were conducted in online mode.\n              The grade cards were prepared by the Institute with features like Barcode, Hologram etc. for restricting\n              duplicity or any malpractice. The course completion certificates with the information such as medium of\n              instruction of the course and the CGPI obtained by the student, instead of provisional degree certificate\n              which were provided by the University, were introduced, and distributed along the grade cards. The\n              transcripts were prepared and provided as per the requirements of the students. In A.Y. 2020-2021 continued with a same scheme CBCGS-H 2019 and introduced three new branches of Bachelor\n              of Technology (B.Tech.) in Artificial Intelligence & Data Structure (AI&DS), Artificial Intelligence &\n              Machine Learning (AI&ML), and Internet of Things (IOT). After the pandemic, as per the guidelines, all the\n              examinations were conducted offline.\n              From the A.Y. 2021-2022, the scheme was revised to CBCGS-HME 2020 with Holistic and Multidisciplinary\n              Education approach, with a 40:60 pattern. Internal Assessment of 40 marks consisting of three In-Semester\n              Examination of 20 marks each considering average of best two out of three, and Innovative Examination of\n              20 Marks and End Semester Examination of 60 marks. The Innovative examination was introduced to inculcate\n              the research aptitude in the students. As per “AICTE INTERNSHIP POLICY: GUIDELINES & PROCEDURES” the 100\n              activity points were introduced and the certificate for the completion of the 100 activity points was\n              issued along with the Semester VIII grade card. Also, there was an increase in intake with additional\n              branches of BE (CS&E, MME, E&CS) and B.VOC (AI&DS). All the examinations were conducted as regular\n              practice. In A.Y. 2022-23 a new branch of B.Voc. (Software Development) was started. All the examinations were\n              conducted as regular practice. The open House and revaluation facility was extended to the repeater\n              students from this academic year.\n              In A.Y. 2022-23, revision of the scheme is done by inclusion of Universal Human Value -II as suggested by\n              AICTE. The evaluation scheme and process were unchanged. The Placement Linked Internship program for Final\n              year BE and B.Tech. was introduced with the online assessment of all internal assessment facility for\n              those who have opted for PLI. Further, for the Specialization (Honours/Minor) Degree, courses offered will\n              be conducted at Institute level in face-to-face mode and evaluated. However, the option for MOOCS and\n              SWAYAM platform will also be open for interested candidates.

With its sustained efforts, it has been facilitating rapid and balanced economic and industrial development of the State. As a part of this strategy, MEDC has accorded top priority in its Agenda, to vital issues such as: MEDC is a ‘development catalyst and investment facilitator’ for the State of Maharashtra – a unique, apolitical and autonomous research organisation working proactively with State Government, Business and Industry, Educationists, Professionals, Bankers, Economists and other leading stakeholders on vital issues of economic development.

TCET emphasizes hands-on learning and project-based assignments\n            as it helps students to develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. These skills\n            are essential for entrepreneurs who need to navigate challenges, identify opportunities, and create\n            successful ventures. This skill based education enhances entrepreneurship and innovation in students.\n            Skill-based education at TCET also fosters lifelong learning.

In order to match these multifarious requirements, AICTE has created a unique mechanism of awarding minimum100 Activity Points over and above the academic grades. AICTE recommends 300-400 hours Activity Programme for each degree student for Community service and allied activities. Every regular student, who is admitted to the 4 years Degree programme, is required to earn 100 Activity Points in addition to the required academic grades, for getting 4 Years degree programme. Students entering 4 years Degree programme through lateral entry are required to earn 75 Activity Points, in addition to the academic grades, for getting 4 years' degree program. Every student is required to prepare a file containing documentary proofs of activities, done by him/ her. This file will be duly verified by the concerned evaluator. The student should earn at least 100 activity points before he/ she appears for his/ her Final Examinations. The points students have earned will be reflected on the student's transcript. However, there will be neither grades/ marks for these points nor will there be any effect on SPI/CPI/CGPA etc. At our institute, we are committed to the holistic development of our students, ensuring they receive not only an excellent education but also comprehensive support for their academic, co-curricular, and personal growth. To this end, we have implemented the Teacher Guardian Scheme, a unique mentorship program designed to provide personalized guidance and support to every student.

{"url": "https://www.tcetmumbai.in/TNP%20aboutInternship.html", "content": "Internships are crucial for students, offering real-world work experience\n                that bridges their academic knowledge with practical application. They help in honing leadership skills\n                and provide a competitive edge in the job market. Recognizing this, TCET’s Training and Placement (T&P)\n                Cell has implemented a mandatory internship requirement for its students. Each student must complete a 4\n                to 6-week internship annually, with credits awarded under the Human Skills Development (HSD) category in\n                accordance with AICTE's internship policies. TCET has established a structured internship program that benefits\n                students from their first year. During the first two years, students are required to complete in-house\n                internships, while the latter two years involve external internships facilitated by the T&P Cell. Upon\n                successful completion, students earn between 12 to 15 credits. This initiative has already provided over\n                9,100 students with valuable internship experiences, significantly enhancing their employability and\n                practical skills.
